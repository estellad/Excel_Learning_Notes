A markdown file dedicated to Excel shortcuts.


## Basics
### General
1. **Toggle between different sheets of the same file**: View > New Window
2. **Increase summary stats**: Highlight a range, then right click the bottom bar to check Average, Min, Max, Sum, etc.
3. **Conditional formating**: Home > Styles. This is for things like color coding every other row, highlighting cells with "ERROR", cell value > 5.
4. **Group**: Data > Outline. This is to quickly hide/unhide things you want to present at a higher level, or more detailed level. 
5. **Freeze top row or left column**: View > Freeze Panes. This is to fix header and rownames while scroll through. 
6. **Spell check**: highlight a range (or click on one cell for checking the entire sheet, or click Ctrl and select multiple tabs for checking the entire workbook), then F7 (fn + F7 if on laptop). If checking for the entire workbook, don't forget to ungroup the sheets after spell check, as any formatting afterwards would affect the entire workbook.
7. **Delimit data**: If separated by "|": Data > Text to Coluns > Delimited > Next > Other: | > Next > Finish. \
                     Side note for **exporting data from pdf**: Inside Adobe pdf document > Tools > Export PDF to any format > Spreadsheet > Export > Save.              
8. **Check format of data**: 

### Like a Pro: No Mouse
**Press Alt**, then press a letter to go into a tab, then press another letter to go into a field. If you need to go back one level, press Esc. Do this for repetitive work, and it will be much faster than using mouse.
